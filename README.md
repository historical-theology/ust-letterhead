# Yale School of Management LaTeX Letterhead

I use [XeLaTeX](http://www.xelatex.org/) via the [MacTex](https://tug.org/mactex/)
distribution on my Macs. XeLaTeX gives you all the
[beauty of LaTeX typesetting](http://nitens.org/taraborelli/latex)
with your Mac system fonts via
[fontspec](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/xetex/latex/fontspec/).

This LaTeX Yale SOM
letterhead conforms to that which I've seen in the wild;
however, SOM's placement of the school shield appears to be non-conforming with the
official [Yale letterhead guidelines](http://www.yale.edu/printer/identity/stationery.html).
This letterhead uses the [Yale typeface](https://yaleidentity.yale.edu/typeface/download-yale-typeface).

Enjoy!
