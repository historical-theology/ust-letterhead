# University of St. Thomas (Houston) ~ Unofficial Letterhead

*Based on the [Yale School of Management's LaTeX letterhead style](https://github.com/kljensen/yale-som-letterhead)*

I have preserved the original's "unlicense."

The University of St. Thomas's branding is available for the 
use of faculty, staff, and students,
according to these official guidelines:

https://www.stthom.edu/Public/getFile.asp?File_Content_ID=100774

Persons not affiliated with the University of St. Thomas and/or
who otherwise cannot abide by those guidelines may *not*
use the UST logo that is provided in the img/ folder.

## Requirements

1. TeXLive or another LaTeX distribution with XeLaTeX

2. Goudy Old Style Regular (for the branded heading)

For ease of use, I have included the file `Goudy Old Style Regular.ttf` 
in this repository's root directory. 
Persons eligible to use the typeface should, 
therefore, not have to do any additional setup.

## Usage

1. Replace Dr. Corey Stephan's information in the template with your own.

2. (Optional) Replace img/signature.png with a transparent facsimile of your own signature.

3. Write your letter.

4. Export with XeLaTeX, e.g. `xelatex letterhead.tex`.
