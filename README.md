# University of St. Thomas (Houston) ~ Unofficial Letterhead

*Heavily customized from the [Yale School of Management's LaTeX letterhead style](https://github.com/kljensen/yale-som-letterhead)*

I have preserved the original's "unlicense."

The University of St. Thomas's branding is available for the 
use of faculty, staff, and students,
according to these official guidelines:

https://www.stthom.edu/Public/getFile.asp?File_Content_ID=100774

Persons not affiliated with the University of St. Thomas and/or
who otherwise cannot abide by those guidelines may *not*
use the UST logo that is provided in the img/ folder.

## Requirements

1. TeXLive or another LaTeX distribution with XeLaTeX

2. Fonts:
a. Goudy Old Style Regular (for the UST branded heading)
b. ET Bembo OT Roman (for the body text) -- or another font of your choosing

For ease of use, I have included the files `Goudy Old Style Regular.ttf`
(proprietary) and `ETBook-OT-Roman.otf` (freely distributable) 
in this repository's root directory. Persons eligible to use
Goudy Old Style Regular and who would like to use ET Book
should, therefore, be able to use the directory as-is with XeLaTeX.

## Usage

1. Replace Dr. Corey Stephan's information in the template with your own.

2. (Optional) Replace img/signature.png with a transparent facsimile of your own signature.

3. Write your letter.

4. Export with XeLaTeX, e.g. `xelatex letterhead.tex`.
