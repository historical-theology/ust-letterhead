# Yale School of Management LaTeX Letterhead

I use [XeLaTeX](http://www.xelatex.org/) via the [MacTex](https://tug.org/mactex/)
distribution on my Macs. XeLaTeX gives you all the
[beauty of LaTeX typesetting](http://nitens.org/taraborelli/latex)
with your Mac system fonts via
[fontspec](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/xetex/latex/fontspec/).

This LaTeX Yale SOM
letterhead conforms to that which I've seen in the wild;
however, SOM's placement of the school shield appears to be non-conforming with the
official [Yale letterhead guidelines](http://www.yale.edu/printer/identity/stationery.html).
This letterhead uses the [Yale typeface](http://www.yale.edu/printer/typeface/),
by [Matthew Carter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Carter),
which you can [download](http://www.yale.edu/printer/typeface/download.html)
if you are a Yalie. You'll want to use [fontforge](http://fontforge.org/)
to convert the fonts from
[PostScript Type 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript_fonts#Type_1)
to [OpenType](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType) format. (If you're
at Yale, you can also e-mail me and I'll share them with you in OTF format.)
Once they are in OTF format, you can install them on your Mac and use them
in XeLaTeX.

Enjoy!
